#Writing first Python program using print() function:
print("Hello World") #Using double quotes to print string.
print('Hello World') #Using single quotes to print string.
print("""Hello World""") #Using 3 double quotes to print string.
print('''Hello World''') #Using 3 single quotes to print string.
print('my name is "Rahul"') #outer single quotes are used to print inner double quotes in a string.
print("my name is 'Rahul'") #outer double quotes are used to print inner single quotes in a string.
print('''my name is "Rahul"''') #outer 3 single quotes are used to print inner double quotes in a string.
print("""my name is 'Rahul'""") #outer 3 double quotes are used to print inner single quotes in a string.
print('my name is """Rahul"""') #outer single quotes are used to print 3 inner double quotes in a string.
print("my name is '''Rahul'''") #outer double quotes are used to print 3 inner single quotes in a string.
print(5, 10.25, True, [1,2,3], (1,2,3), {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3}, {1,2,3})
'''Note: Not only string variable even int, float, bool, list, tuple, dictionary and set data types 
can be printed using print() function.'''

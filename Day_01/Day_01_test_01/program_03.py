#Understanding Concatenation:
x = 'Python'
y = 'Programming'

#Addition operation with String is called "Concatenation"
print(x+y) #output: PythonProgramming
#Note: When the data types are string only Concatenation(addition operation) is supported and other mathematical operation are not supported.

#Repeatation Operation: String Multiplication
a = "Bangalore "
b = 5
print(a*b) #output: BangaloreBangaloreBangaloreBangaloreBangalore
#Note: Multiplication(*) between string and a number is a repeatation operator.

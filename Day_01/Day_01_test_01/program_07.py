#Logical Operator: <, >, <=, >=, == and !=
#Note: Output of Logical operators is always Boolean
#Note: True = 1 and False is 0. Hence, True is always greater than False.
x = True
y = False

print(x < y) #output: False, Because 1(True) is not lesser than 0(False).

print(x > y) #output: True, Because 1(True) is greater than 0(False).

print(x <= y) #output: False, Because 1(True) is not lesser than or equal to 0(False).

print(x >= y) #output: True, Because 1(True) is greater than but not equal to 0(False). At least one condition is True.

print(x == y) #output: False, Because 1(True) is not equal to 0(False).

print(x != y) #output: True, Because 1(True) is not equal to 0(False).

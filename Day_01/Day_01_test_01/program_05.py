#Logical Operator: <, >, <=, >=, == and !=

x = 5.5
y = 17.2

print(x < y) #output: True, Because x is lesser than y.

print(x > y) #output: False, Because x is not greater than y.

#Similar to x < y or x == y; Either of the condition can match.
print(x <= y) #output: True, Because x is lesser than y but not equal at least one condition is True.

#Similar to x > y or x == y; Either of the condition can match.
print(x >= y) #output: False, Because x is neither greater than nor equal to y none of the condition is True.

print(x == y) #output: False, Because x is not equal to y.

print(x != y) #output: True, Because x is not equal to y.

print(x != y) #output: True

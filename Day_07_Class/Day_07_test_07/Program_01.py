#Class creation in Python:

class Employee:
    pass #pass can be used in class, method, if-else, loops wherever you don't want to write anything and to make program syntatically correct.
obj1=Employee() #obj1 is reference variable
#print(type(obj1), obj1) #output: <class '__main__.Employee'> <__main__.Employee object at 0x0000016363DD7400>
